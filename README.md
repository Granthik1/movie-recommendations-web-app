# Movie Recommendations Web App

The project is built using Machine Learning with
Cosine Similarity. Users can select a movie from a provided list to receive personalized
recommendations, with the model predicting and displaying 10 suggestions. The current
database comprises 12,000 movies spanning from 2008 to the current year, with plans for
future database upgrades.
I apologize if the specific movie you're searching for is not available on the web app. Feel free to explore the recommendations and discover new and exciting films!
